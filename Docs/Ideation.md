## (General) Potential Problems

* Sharing results and inputs;
* Scaling code, what everyone can work on;
* Graphing - often tedious and gets in the way (I have some solutions hanging around for this);
* Results - see above - but also choice of scoring and reporting.
* Plug n' Play means we don't have anything new - but plug n' play is damn easy (env. diffs will throw trained models if using Pickle, even if OS is similar...) - you're 12am brain means pre-trained models btw XD

## Ideas

1. Summariser
2. Genre Plot Writer
3. Plot Twister (take two plots and make a new plot from them)

### SWOTs

1. **Summariser**
#### S:
* Simple, minimal complexity overhead and ease of implementation. "It's been done before"
#### W: 
* "It's been done before"
* Not on point enough ("not plotty")
#### O:
* Reduce, reuse, recycle
#### T: 
* Not enough complexity
* Not related enough

2. **Genre Plot Writer**

https://medium.com/deep-learning-with-keras/fundamentals-of-text-generation-745d66238a1f

#### S:
* On point,
* Relatively complex, enough to bite into,
#### W: 
* No original spin - just another tutorial spin off "Hello World"
* 'Potenially' not complex enough!
#### O:
* Could be built on, plenty to expand with
* Will require multiple patterns
* some room for creativity,
* well known enough to analyse results easily, lot's of room for "Data" engineering to actually friggen happen
#### T: 
* Too simple still, on the face of it,
* Not fun (sounding) enough, so I'm sure people will become bored
* idk got bored by this point, already written this off

1. **Plot Twister**
#### S:
* Unique, interesting,
* Existing base is idea 2. so there is room for iteration into this idea (if time permits)
* relevant and on point,
* decent technical complexity, but...(see T first point)
* expected result is unkown, which is exploratory...
* it just sounds fancy - it's probably useless - but it sells well
#### W: 
* time intensive on me, more reliance on my experience to scale and keep progress moving,
* more difficult to evaluate, *it's unique*
#### O:
* It's new, so space to stamp out some creativity,
* It's complex enough to call on several concepts to applied, learning opportunity is clear and present
* would require multiple datasets from differing domains/genres/sources to train, more data loading complexity but this could be more interesting to explore than a standard ETL...
#### T: 
* technical complexity may seem daunting, even when explained, 
* overhead of producing idea 2. then this may be too long for 1 studio (will not be cont. next sem)
